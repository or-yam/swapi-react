# SWAPI with create-react-app

couldn't find a way to get all vehicles without pagination.
Since there is no upcoming Star-wars movie, I assumed that the number of results will stay constant: 39 vehicles in 4 pages.
After the first fetch the data will be stored in local-storage.

Just for fun, The bar-chart is displayed as lightsabers.
